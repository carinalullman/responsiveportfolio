            <div class="bio">Hello! Thanks for reading my bio. I was born and raised in a lovely city called Santa
                Barbara. At the age of 18 I joined the United States Air Force
                and worked in health services management (a fancy name for medical admin).
                In San Antonio, TX I worked in the Emergency Room of a Level I Trauma hospital and realized I wanted to
                be in the action as a
                nurse. I worked full time and went to school full time and finally graduated with my BSN
                in 2016. I am very proud of being a nurse and I hope to take my skills to the next level and write
                medical software since I am familiar with the user's needs. I love to challenge myself and I am doing so
                in DU's Coding Bootcamp.
                On my off time I enjoy snowboarding, yoga, hiking (all things active), traveling and seeing obscure bands at small venues.
                I am very excited to see where this Boot Camp takes me!
